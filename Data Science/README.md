At this folder, I have a lot of works, because there were just a few and they are in the "same world".

## Data Science file
In this project, I made predictions for the classic handwritten digits dataset using support vector machines.
It was one of my first works in the area, but I needed to apply principal component analysis, hyperparameter tuning and even optimization to reduce the calculation time for the algorithms.

## Machine Learning files
Now, in these files, the least squares algorithm is used pure and with regularization terms, for comparison purposes.
Then, in the second part, we used unsupervised algorithms to make the predictions about the quality score of the wines we were analyzing.

## Artificial Intelligence files
Finally, in the work "AI-Group work - 1" we implemented the visualization of five search algorithms for graphs.
And, in "AI-Group work - 2" we just analyzed four datasets and tested four classification algorithms, again, for comparison purposes.
