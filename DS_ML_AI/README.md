At this folder, I have a lot of works, because there were just a few and they are in the "same world".
So, explaining the letters: 'DS' for 'Data Science', 'ML' for 'Machine Learning' and 'AI' for 'Artificial Intelligence'.

In the DS file, I made predictions for the classic handwritten digits dataset using support vector machines.
It was one of my first works in the area, but I was already able to apply principal component analysis, hyperparameter tuning and even optimization to reduce the time the algorithms needed for calculations.

Now, in the "ML" files, the least squares algorithm is used "raw" and with regularization terms.
Then, in the second part, we used unsupervised algorithms to make the predictions about the quality score of the wines we were analyzing.

Finally, in the work "AI-Group work - 1" we implemented the visualization of five search algorithms for graphs.
See below the video of the A* algorithm finding the lowest cost path between two vertices of a KNN(2500, 7) graph:
