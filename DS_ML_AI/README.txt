At this folder, I have a lot of works, because there were just a few and they are in the "same world".
So, explaining the letters: 'DS' for 'Data Science', 'ML' for 'Machine Learning' and 'AI' for 'Artificial Intelligence'.

In the DS file, I made predictions for the classic handwritten digits dataset using support vector machines.
It was one of my first works in the area, but I was already able to apply principal component analysis, hyperparameter tuning and even optimization to reduce the time the algorithms needed for calculations.
