# Survival Analysis

This subject proved to be very interesting as the teacher passed each modeling technique.
I mean, Kaplan-Meier is simple and extremely useful for initial analyses, while semi and parametric models are the classic statistical forecasting tools.

So, I have here two group works in which we applied the techniques of analysis (with Kaplan-Meier, in the first file) and modeling (semi and parametric, in the second) on a dataset in the context of crowdfunding project.

I also have a separate report solving the best model selection problem, for a dataset provided by the teacher.
