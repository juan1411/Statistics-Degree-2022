# Survival Analysis

This subject (school) proved to be very interesting as the teacher passed each form of modeling.
You see, Kaplan-Meier is simple and extremely useful for initial analyses, while semi and parametric models are the classic statistical forecasting tools.

So, I have here two group works in which we applied the techniques of analysis (with Kaplan-Meier, in the first file) and modeling (semi and parametric, in the second) on a dataset in the context of survival analysis.

I also have a separate report where the best parametric model is selected, and then the best semiparametric model as well, for a dataset provided by the teacher.
