# Artificial Intelligence

In the work "AI-Group work - 1" we implemented the visualization of five search algorithms for graphs.

The last time we ran the codes, we generated this graph

Thus, the answer provided by the depth-first search is as follows:

Unlike the answer obtained by the A* algorithm, which is as follows:

And, in "AI-Group work - 2" we just analyzed four datasets and tested four classification algorithms, for comparison purposes.
